"""
Generate 6 POV / lifestyle photos for the 3 "Highest Rated (With Photos)" review
cards in no-lab.html. Two photos per card, matched to the card's narrative.

We pass nf_product_1box_cream.png as the reference image so the generated scenes
show the correct Restural coffee box (cream/navy label) rather than an invented
product. Style target: real iPhone photo — not product photography.

Output: /v2-images/social/nf_review_photo_01.png ... nf_review_photo_06.png
        (mirrored to /Restural Pages/v2-images/social/)
